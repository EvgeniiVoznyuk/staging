          question: 'What is staking?',
          answer: `
            <p>Staking allows EDG holders to participate in the security and availability of Edgeware by leveraging their tokens to validate.</p>
            <p>Validators who stake EDG, have an operational validator node, and behave honestly will get rewarded with EDG.</p>
            <p>Actors who misbehave or who are unavailable/offline will have a portion of their stake slashed as a penalty.</p>

        },
        {
          question: 'What do I need to stake?',
          answer: `
            <p>To become a nominator, you only need to have some EDG to stake.</p>
          `,
        },
        {
          question: 'What is nominating?',
          answer: `
            <p>A nominator publishes a list of validator candidates that they trust, and puts down an amount of EDG at stake to support them with.</p>
            <p>If some of these candidates are elected as validators, they share with them the payments, or the sanctions, on a per-staked-EDG basis.</p>
            <p>Unlike validators, an unlimited number of parties can participate as nominators. As long as a nominator is diligent in their choice and only supports validator candidates with good security practices, their role carries low risk and provides a continuous source of revenue.</p>
          `,
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I nominate multiple validators?',
          answer: `
            <p>Yes. Validators are selected via the Phragmen Method. You can think of this is a version of "approval voting" - you can approve zero, one, or multiple validators (although of course, if you do not nominate any validators, you are not nominating and thus will not receive any rewards).</p>
            <p>For a more in-depth explanation of Phragmen, please see the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/en/latest/polkadot/learn/phragmen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot Wiki Phragmen</a> page.</p>
