          More about Chainlink and Everstake
        </h2>
        <p>
          Everstake deployed its own Oracle node within the Chainlink infrastructure. The more nodes involved in supporting the network, the more secure it is, and the information processed becomes more accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the Everstake team contributes to the development of the ecosystem and together with Chainlink creates a secure environment for financial transactions on the blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are happy to inform you that Oracle Everstake has successfully processed <a href="https://stake.is/M/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 35 thousand transactions</a> for the Chainlink blockchain network. We are not going to stop there and will continue to support and help the projectâ€™s infrastructure to improve.

            <p>Chainlink connects smart contracts to real world data, events and payments. In order to prevent a single point of failure, Chainlink is operated by a decentralized oracle network. To learn more, please see Chainlink's <a href="https://link.smartcontract.com/whitepaper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>.</p>

            <p>Chainlink node operators bring external data directly to smart contracts. Since some smart contracts, in particular for DeFi, manage a lot of value, the external data they rely on must be accurate and reliable. Node operators need to bring industry best practices to managing their infrastructure.</p>
