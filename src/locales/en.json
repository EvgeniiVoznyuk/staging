        "answer": [
          "Staking is a concept of an alternative mining process on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, which allows cryptocurrency holders to lock up their digital assets for a certain period of time in exchange for rewards that they constantly get over time proportionally to the amount of staked cryptocurrency. Everyone who participates in the staking, delegates their cryptocurrency to different Validators who run validating nodes which in the end confirm transactions on the network."

        "answer": [
          "Usually, voters can have annual rewards that vary in the range of 6% to 36%, and the amount of distributed rewards depends on the number of staked ICX tokens on the network. So, in case thereâs a small amount of staked tokens, then network participants will receive higher rewards, and once the number of staked ICX grows, then users will receive smaller rewards. Network participants are getting rewards in I-Score, which allows claiming a certain number of ICX from the Public Treasury.",
          "Staking rewards are subject to change, and by the end of 2019 or in 2020, ICON Foundation is planning to release EEP and DApp delegation processes, which will require all network participants to stake ICX tokens with such types of the network entities as: P-Reps, DApps, EEPs in order to receive complete amount of rewards that range between 6% and 36%. In case a user decides to vote only for one type of the network entity, he will be getting from 2% to 12% in annual rewards."

          "You have always control over your staked ICX tokens, but in case you decide to interrupt the staking process, aborting the lock-up period, then you become the subject to 6% burn penalty. But it happens only if P-Rep that you have staking with is not an active participant, then he will be penalized by the network. So penalties occur when the P-Repâs block producing rate decreases below 85%. Moreover, if the P-Rep was detected while conducting network disrupting activities, then he will be penalized as well, so it very important to choose a well-known P-Rep with high reputation."

      "11": {
        "question": "Whatâs the reason for staking?",
        "answer": [

        "answer": [
          "In case you have staked ICX with a P-Rep who was penalized, then 6% of the total amount of staked coins gets burned. But usually, these situations happen rarely, and if you vote for a P-Rep who has a good reputation, then thereâs no need to worry much.",
          "The penalty mechanism consists of three scenarios where P-Reps can get penalized for inappropriate behavior, and those are Low Productivity Penalty, Disqualification Penalty, and Validation Penalty. These chastisements play a vital role in the stability of the network, but if anyone crosses these lines, then they incur a 6% token burn out of the total amount of staked cryptocurrency."

        "answer": [
          "Delegating your ICX to Everstake will successfully increase your yields while keeping your digital assets secure. Almost any Proof-of-Stake blockchain network such as ICON requires running a node with an appropriate hardware set-up, stable internet connection, and constant maintenance. If one of these factors is not met, then you are risking to lose a potential reward once the validating node finds the block. Instead of having your masternode in unpredictable conditions, run it in a world-class data center under accurate control of our specialists."
